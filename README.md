# Lily

Lily is a collection of tools for the calibration of lidar sensors.

You might be wondering why the project is named as it is, given its function seems unrelated. At its core, this is a lidar2lidar calibration tool. While 'Lily' typically connotes a person's name, its origin here is a bit more nuanced. When I was conceptualizing this project, it struck me that 'lidar2lidar' phonetically echoes 'double li'. This inspired the name 'Lily'. Additionally, 'Lily' is also the title of a song I deeply admire, crafted by the Chinese artist, Li Jian. If it piques your curiosity, I'd recommend exploring his work.
